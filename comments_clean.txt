Of the same trick, chasing buyer back and forth with bad intention not to take care or responsible for any thing. The worst is really that this cheater is a big lier on Ebay!!!! Why keeping this seller around!!!!!', 'neg',

I asked for a partial refund and was only offered my shipping costs back‚Ä¶ terrible customer service. I sent pictures in the day I received the item to show the issues.

Be careful when buying from this person. The seller attempted to keep my money and only offered an eight dollar refund on a $500 order. If it had not been for PayPal, I would not have gotten a full refund from the seller.', 'neg',

'Bag literally stinks. Response from seller- I was told that it is used. I don\'t know about you, but I have many bags and none of the stink! Who buys a bag knowing that it smells. Nothing in ad about the stench permeating from bag. Note to seller, you need to rethink your grading scale if you grade something as in good shape when it stinks to high heaven.Ôøº.
