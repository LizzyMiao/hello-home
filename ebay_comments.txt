Very fast shipping. Accurate description
I love everything about the bag, it also arrived on time. Thanks I enjoy doing business with you.
There was a key photo missing from the listing which would have depicted the worst part of this bag. I ended up really liking the bag (though measurements were also off) & decided to keep it as the seller did offer a partial refund. This led to an overall positive experience.
For second hand herbag the price a bit high, and the dirty area can‚Äôt 100% show in the picture. But is Authentic. Even I saw negative comments, I also afraid, but the buyer accept 30 days return. Ôøº This gives me confidence.
Fake item with same number is list on various site.. had it authenticated and this item is fake    0    https://www.ebay.com/itm/314060438578

BUYER BEWARE!!! I PURCHASED TWO BAGS ON 1/28/22, BOTH BAGS WERE USED AND ONE WAS DESCRIBED AS HAVING A STAIN. WHEN THE BAG ARRIVED THE STAIN WAS MUCH WORSE THAT WHAT THE PICTURES DEPICTED. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACED THE SELLER AND REQUESTED A REFUND. ON 2/15/22 I RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE SELLER TELLING ME THAT MY MOST CURRENT ORDER FROM 2/7/22 HAD BEEN CANCELLED AND REFUNDED BECAUSE I REQUESTED A REFUND AND THEY ARE NO LONGER SELLING TO JAPANESE CUSTOMERS. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!    0
Won Gucci backpack, was charged $219.89, and was waiting on it. Finally looked up why I hadn't received item, saw that the seller canceled the sale. Was refunded money 15 hours after I paid for it. Never contacted me.    0
Stinky and Nasty! I want a refund for the garbage that you sold me! The smell is so bad, i had to put it out in my garage to keep from throwing up! Where is my $275 that i wasted on this junk?    0
The seller has added a further ¬£30 after the auction ended. I've message them ùôèùôíùôÑùòæùôÄ and both times, asking for an explanation. As it's too late to cancel the order, I will not be making a payment to this seller.    0
Item was packaged neatly and the shipping speed was lightening fast ! Item was in mint condition. Thank you 
Very stylish collection! Thank you. Want to keep them for gifts to a few friends who like the high brand.
Didn't realize I needed to scrape out the whole bag inside because the liner was peeling throughout but now looks great. Outside in great condition
Good bag!worth the money
Fantastic experience! My package was sent promptly, they chose a reliable shipper, and I‚Äôm SO happy with the product. I couldn‚Äôt ask for more!

Very happy about my purchase, the quality is way better than I thought for a C ranking. Shipping is super fast too! However please keep in mind that it‚Äôs very possible to pay 60‚Ç¨ of taxes and TVA. So the price can go up easily (+ the transaction fee)
This is my third purchase from your store and I never get disappointed. Love the bag! Thank you!

Contacted seller within minutes of accidental order placed to request a cancelation. Seller never responded to me.

When order was processed I contacted seller for the 3rd time asking why and if order could please be canceled. Seller never responded to me. I have not received the order either.    0

Amazing seller! Item as described. Fast shipping! Thank you so much!! I love it!
Very good Ebayer, fast shipping item as described if not better, will definitely buy again from him. Thank you
The item was indeed a great buy! Almost new! I'm so happy! Will definitely buy again from seller.
Fantastic seller! I Highly recommend!!! Very knowledgeable and helpful. The best service I have ever received from a seller on Ebay! AAA+!!!
I‚Äôd happily deal with again!! Love the bag and thanks for the great communication
Prompt delivery, excellent service, highly recommended seller, many thanks, Will be back. 5 Stars 
Beautiful condition, better then described, looks like new. Arrived faster then expected. Thank you so much
The handbag is so much better than I expected, it looks slightly used and very clean inside. It was packaged professionally. Communication with seller is great. Thank you.
Excellent designer item in even better condition than expected. Verified authentic by 3rd party. Thank you!
The bag was fine. The reason I am leaving a negative is because of the seller's irresponsible shipping & poor customer service. They incorrectly coded the purse as a 'man's overcoat' with a 30% duty as opposed to 9% which is what the duty is on a leather purse. I contacted the seller--no response, no help. After a lot of effort, I got it fixed through DHL. I would have paid $350 over for their mistake. See all the other people who said they paid 30% in the FB? The were overcharged. BEWARE!!!    0
WOW WOW Amazing seller*** Professional service and speedy delivery. Received my beautiful bag in less than a week! Superb communication throughout. Will definitely buy again and I love the bag. Thank you and I am over the moon with it!
OMG, the best seller I have encountered in a very long time. So professional.
Description and photos were very deceptive. It was a MINI Tote not a standard-sized one. It was supposed to be free shipping and in fine print, possible import charges may be incurred. I was charged over 30% in handling fees and import charges when item was already being shipped. AND they have no return policy. BUYER BEWARE!     0
Prompt, professional and reliable. I really appreciated the frequent communication provided by this Seller and highly recommend their product and services. Everything came exactly as described. Will definitely use them again.
Coming for Japan this order arrived threes days before Christmas. Estimated arrival was Wednesday the 29thÔøº and it got here on the 22. Thank you Kyounokra!
Wow! Amazing fast delivery! To the United States. In 5 days. That‚Äôs just Astonishing! Happy with the purse, very nice condition. Will definitely do business again. Arigato gozaimasu! 
The bag is beautiful and in wonderful condition! There was an import duty which was unexpected; but I love the bag. Thank you:)
Very good service provided regular updates and quick shipping. There was an extra import/duty tax fee that I had to pay but that isn't any fault of the seller. Buyers should look up how much the tax will be as I hadn't factored it into my budget when I bought this handbag. I'm very happy with the product, it was exactly how it looked in the pictures.
Wonderful Prada bag accurately described and safely sent via DHL. Thank you to a great seller!
As a first time Ebay buyer, this international seller (Japan) did not provide the correct description for the shoulder bag I purchased ($417) and sent me a crossbody shoulder bag so left out important details. But now after 1 week still expects me to pay return shipping which equals half the price of the handbag ($188) and I think this is unfair so I would never recommend this seller.    0
Excellent seller. Checked that I was ok with bag not coming with key etc before it was sent. Arrived very quickly. Very pleased and would use this seller again.
This bag is All the right details as described on the post. Updated all processed since ordering. Used DLH for shipping, it‚Äôs quite fast delivery.
I strongly recommend this seller, not only the item is authentic, but also delivery was fast, and they informed you every step of the process of delivery so you know what's going on. The bag I bought is exactly like the pictures, the stain on the bag was actually not visible but the photos detailed it and make you think the flaw is huge but it is NOT, this just shows their HONESTY. The bag came with a dust bag and a purchased prove, which is a surprise. I am very happy with the purchase
Super Fast Intl Shipping, Trustworthy seller, Excellent Communication, Fast reponses, Definitely will Do Business with these seller, You can count on authentication of their products.
really impressed: great communication, shipped to Germany within 5 days, great price, Prada bag perfectly as described! Highly recommend this seller and love to do business with you again! Thank you so much!
I am not happy with this purchase at all. I have been in hbag biz for 30 years in NYC. Sorry to tell you but believe not real Gucci. The back zip pocket zipper does not close shut. The handle attachments are crooked and too short. Hard for bag to hold. Handles bend at attachment bc so tight. I always purchase from Japan. First time ever been this disappointed. Based on how seem I do not believe authentic    0
The bag is really old the price is not worth it .    0
Love the look of this purse. It seems very vintage looking. I ordered another in brown. Easy transaction. Thank you. Take good care. Stay safe.

Fast delivery. Good looking bag. Very, Very nice. Exactly what the seller described, photographed. Shipped in good packaging. Shipping cost a little bit high, I thought. It comes in under 2 lbs. I'd have offered Parcel Select for $7.28 Hey, 3 bucks is $3. ha ! That's what I do anyway. Good communication throughout. Lenny's a good egg. Thanks very much. Great Seller!
The handbag exceeded my expectations right down to the detail given for the package. . Sellers communication was great. I am truly grateful.
OmGosh thank you for packaging my purse so beautifully, what a nice surprise! The extra gift of perfume was such a lovely touch. And it smells great I‚Äôm wearing it right now
Fabulous experience with the seller. The purse is practically pristine. She let me know when I could expect to receive it (and I did receive it 2 days later), it was carefully packaged and shipped promptly. I would absolutely do business with her once again.
I wish I could give you more than five stars. Thank you for an exemplary experience; from the carefully packed, lightning fast parcel and shipping to the transparency of the description, to the quality of this simply beautiful handbag. It was a pleasure working with you and I look forward to patronizing your business again. Thank you for the best experience I've ever had on eBay.
Super fast shipping and item was in immaculate condition. Item was securely packed with care and amazing communication seller! Truly 5-stars - happy to buy from again. The added sample gift was a very nice touch. Thank you so much!

An amazing seller in every capacity - love my purse and had exceptional service!!
I love this Coach handbag. But, my daughter wanted it more and now she has it!
Hello, this item arrived today and It was the perfect color and matched the bag I already have! The photos are way more orange than the in person color, and I'm glad it was the putty color and not the orange color! Thanks so much and thanks for the extra gift! I will be keeping this item and have removed the void tag.
The purse arrived timely and in excellent shape. The wrapping was beautiful and I also received a little free gift. The purse was better than described . I will definitely order from this company again. I am extremely satisfied!

This clock was packaged the best I've ever bought off of ebay. It arrived safely and ahead of schedule. Thanks!
Nice little bag. My only complaint is I wanted to message seller with a question and seller did not accept messages. So I was unable to ask anything about this bag.
Item was exactly as described, packaged with care, and shipping was fast! Very happy with my purchase!
Very happy with purchase and seller. The post office took forever and it kept going back to Florida and then back to NJ. Very pleasantly surprised with condition of bag. Beautiful handbag!
JUST ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!! What a lovely pair together. Thank you!!!
The seller had excellent communication skills. I asked some questions about the handbag & wallet. She sent additional pictures, which really helped. I received the handbag & wallet yesterday, and I absolutely love it! The price was great, and the shipping was really fast! Will definitely buy from this seller again.
Very pleased with this bag! Excellent condition and looks every bit as good in person as in the pictures. Speedy delivery, too.

Excellent service and product. We received our package around 11am. FedEx was very unprofessional. As we were never asked to sign fir our package. I was standing outside and received two package to accept, yet nothing.
I was super happy with the speed of delivery & items were in excellent condition. Loved the extra care taken in packaging my purchase.
Beautiful! Super fast shipping. A+++ seller! Thank you!

Very Nice product, fast shipping, super smooth and easy transaction, thoroughly enjoyed doing business with this seller
Very fair price for a used leather, prestige-brand bag. Item is in great condition, was packaged adequately, and arrived in a fair amount of time. The seller was accommodating, pleasant, timely and communicative. I would purchase from this merchant again w/o hesitation. No regrets. Checks the GOOD PURCHASE box on my end.
The seller really surprised me with their generous refund and much appreciated on my part. I‚Äôll definitely be watching for other tokens on your sight that I might need. Thank You Very Much
We received the backpack quickly and it is gorgeous. My husband was so thrilled with it: the leather, the workmanship, everything! He's one happy guy. Thank you so much. This was our second purchase from you and we'll be back again!
I really like the bag, ordered another for my dad, the only problem, there was some sticky goo (maybe from where it was stored?), on one of the straps, but I managed to clean it off with a serviette, other than that I have no complaints, great value for money.
Item , as seller mentioned, was supposed to be a soft genuine leather , but it was not.    0
The bag came very quickly. But overall I‚Äôm not happy with it. First of all it smells weird. It‚Äôs not pure leather smell like leather quality shoes or jackets. The smell is not pleasant. Internal material is very low quality. The oil that the bag was treated with is greasy and stays on hands. I put this bag out of package in front of the open window but it still smells weird. Not a luxury product as advertised. Also the metal elements left marks on one side of the bag. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again.    0
Thanks you for the bag. Very good tailoring quality, good material. The color is slightly different from the picture, the bag is a little lighter, but this does not spoil it, it looks very solid and beautiful. The delivery is very fast. Thanks! Highly recommend!

Bulk items are not all authentic gucci....pictures are photo shopped to appear better. A waist of my time....very dissapointed.    0
The seller was correct it is junk but do not say it is also fake. I ripped the bags and inside was cartoon and cheap materials. Gucci do not use these cheap glue, paper and crappy leather. Make you own research, vintage brands are more expensive in Japan mire than the US. Be aware and check the purchase (if you already made it) with Authenticator and you will see the results. By the way they are a number of them from Japan and it seems they are connected if not the same group, good luck.    0

The bag surprised me! I paid 398$ and it‚Äôs a lot for a bag in this condition! Totally useless. I couldn‚Äôt touch inside. It was like glue. I could not clean it. It was extremely sticky.

Was an easy transaction but the bag BROKE the FIRST time I used it. I sent photos and immediately contacted them. The seller accepted the "return" but wouldn't pay for shipping. So I had to spend $60 on a bag that I didn't even use. Not good business. Will NEVER buy again.       0

Though not "RE-COLORED" which is very normal for this seller on every BALENCIAGA and other bag.... This bag arrived with a tear of leather part + a big hole on the zipper + broken strap!!!!! Certainly, not mentioning in the description. WHY! Cheater! Right! Fully know that returning item internationally is complicated and almost impossible cost and process wise!!!! Not every once in a while, I got 4 junk items in 1 order!!!! Buyer suffer from this seller!!! EBAY - you need really consider this!!      0
Be mindful of a very small description "RE-COLORED"!!! All are of bad quality. This purple bag arrived with sticky surface!!! Handles sticked to the bag. When separating them, the color come off!!!!! Refuse to help buyer fixing the problem by getting it fix with support/partial refund. Of the same trick, chasing buyer back and forth with bad intention not to take care or responsible for any thing. The worst is really that this cheater is a big lier on Ebay!!!! Why keeping this seller around!!!!!      0

DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! This bag has a tear/ hole in the leather. I spent a lot of money on it‚Ä¶. The tear/ hole was not shown in the pictures nor was it listed in the description. There‚Äôs also adhesive some sort of glue all over the creases of the bag. I‚Äôm beyond unhappy with my purchase. I asked for a partial refund and was only offered my shipping costs back‚Ä¶ terrible customer service. I sent pictures in the day I received the item to show the issues. Angry is an understatement!     0

Seller lied and said the item sold on another platform DAYS before she realized I purchased it and had to cancel my order. I searched for it and found the listing, it sold two days AFTER I purchased for almost double. I sent the seller a screenshot to show them I knew they were lying and I have not heard back since.     0
Lovely purse but it has very noticeable imperfections/wear & tear that were not mentioned in the description nor were they visible in the photographs. They‚Äôre quite visible in real life though. Would not have bought the purse if I‚Äôd been aware      0
This bag was way worse shape than wasÔøº portrayed. After using it a couple of times legit about 3 bc i was worried about condition the handle broke Ugh my husband was already pretty upset i bought such a gross looking bag then the handle broke to top it off.     0
Horrible condition no zipper    0
The handle on this bag was almost torn off and this was not displayed in the pictures online. I sent the item back and they refunded me the money I paid, eBay had to step in, so in essence, they tried to keep the merchandise and my $325. I would call that stealing, Buyer beware!!!    0
It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be and it seems like it would fit a decent amount of food but it didn't and doesn't..     0

This bag is a FAKE! No LV numbers, nothing. I‚Äôm so disappointed. Certainly won‚Äôt use this seller again.     0
The bag as black ink or something inside that got in everything. Bag was nice on outside but the inside trashed. Tricky because you couldn't tell it until It got on everything. Sad to sell damage items just for a profit.     0

Please respond!    0

this bag is terrible phony and fake all at the same time!!! unbothered, though, as my dog can use it as a chew toy!!!      0
Unfortunately, Article was described not good. There were a lot of holes on top which were not mentioned.    0
This bag was not as described. The zipper hangs out of bag, top of bag has scaled area. Does not appear to be authentic. Very disappointed.     0
Finally had the bag inspected. It is a fake.          0
Purse smelled so bad , took to Louis Vuitton and was told this was fake , brass was not brass, the purse itself was so stiff .. . Asked them to exchange purse . Would not do that .      0
The inside lining of leather is shredding/ peeling so SO a badly that it ruined my wallet, got all over everything and every time I stick my hand in the purse the peeling leather gets all over my fingernails. I‚Äôm SOOOOOOO disappointed!!!!!     0

Terrible odor, unusable- cannot remove. Sent item back over a month ago- no refund. DO NOT BUY.     0
One strap was completely broken from the side. I took the bag to a repair shop (2 actually) and was told that it would cost $110 to just fix that one strap - not including the metal casing where the leather was also damaged. They also stated that the other 3 straps were about to go as well. All in - they told me it would cost over $400 for the repairs as the leather straps were weak and pulled apart but the straps around the metal casing were also damaged.     0
Please refund this item. It was completely FAKE and I am very upset that I got misled as that is just wrong to do to people on here. I would like my money back please.       0
Horrible experience. Wasn't satisfied with the item and when I sent the item back the seller stop responding to my messages!!     0
Seller answers no questions / messages before, during and even after purchase.      0
negative, trash.     0
Item description is not good in my opinion. Pictures don‚Äôt show the reality. The bag I received is cheap. Cardboard bag covered by ¬´ leather ¬ª. If I knew how cheaply made this YSL vintage bag was, I never would‚Äôve bought it. Big regret. Money thrown out of the window. The rest of the transaction went well, seller shipped it fast. Because of description/pictures lacking reality i will probably not buy again.    0
This was a fake! I would like my money back...    0
